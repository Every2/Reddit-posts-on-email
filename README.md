*Requirements: Python 3.8+, Praw, google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib*

If you want add a database I will show examples with mongodb (so install pymongo, but if you will use a server should install pymongo[srv])

You may have trouble installing google requirements and pymongo[srv], if you have trouble try:

`
pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib pymongo[srv]
`
